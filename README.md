#Data
Because the limitation of github, the original datasets are in BaiduPan, you can see in the email attachment.
The data contains three parts. The first one is a smaller dataset about car image segmentation. The second one is a larger dataset about car image segmentation. The third one is the cell dataset, which appears in the paper.

#Train
The file train.py is to train the first dataset. The file train2.py is to train the second dataset. The file train3.py is to train the third dataset.

#Output of prediction
The cell_OUT and car_output is the result of the prediction.
